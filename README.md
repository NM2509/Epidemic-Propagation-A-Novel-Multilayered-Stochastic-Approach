Title: Incorporating Household Structure into Branching Processes for Epidemic Propagation: A Novel Multilayered Stochastic Approach with SIR Transmission and Cluster Isolation.

This work presents a new epidemiological model that is based on a branching process with an addition of household structure to better capture non-random patterns of contact between individuals. The code provided in this repository has been used for simulations and analysis of such model.
