## Incorporating Household Structure into Branching Processes for Epidemic Propagation: A Novel Multilayered Stochastic Approach with SIR Transmission and Cluster Isolation

This repository contains the codebase for my MSc Dissertation in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford. The research presents a new epidemiological model that is based on a branching process with an addition of household structure to better capture non-random patterns of contact between individuals. The code provided in this repository has been used for simulations and analysis of such model.

| Filename       | Description     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File 0         | Defines functions for model inputs and their default values                                       |
| File 1         | Defining `Household` class                                                                        |
| File 2         | Defining `Cluster` class. We only use this class when running simulations to determine the average number of child clusters, as it substantially increases run time of simulations.                                |
| File 3         | Functions to identify households for isolation (isolation of a cluster)                                 |
| File 4         | Function to get a cluster by its ID. Only used if we are running simulations to get the average number of child clusters                                  |
| File 5         | Choosing an event out of 'birth','recovery','detection','infection'                                  |
| File 6         | Choosing a node that a previously chosen event will apply to                                   |
| File 7         | Faster cumulative sum function using numba                                   |
| File 8         | Main simulation function. Requires files 0-7                                   |
| File 9         | Main function for section 6 of the dissertation. This function provides an unbiased estimate of the Basic Reproduction Number, given parameter inputs. Requires file 0                                  |
| KS Statistic         | Code for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for section 7 of the dissertation                                  |
